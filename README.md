# Motivation

The course provides an in depth guide to best practices in the python language and gives insights even 
the most experience programmer could benefit from. It shows how simple but tedious tasks could easily be
automated which I believe is quite powerful

Environment: `Python3`

## Installation 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nicolabc/Automate-The-Boring-Stuff
cd Automate-The-Boring-Stuff/
python3 [filename.py]
```
>Note that some packages may be required in order to run the code
